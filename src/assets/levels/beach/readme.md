# minimap-codes
there are 16 ways for tiles in a minimap, bc every exit can be coded binary. So hex values can be used for represetning minimap.
the order of the exits is *top, left, right, bottom*
so this tile:
 
 ```
...
.  
. .
```

is ```0011``` and therefore ```3```

the minimap is written in lines, each line is 1 hex string
