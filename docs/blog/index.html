                                    But DialThetti, why do you need an engine? Other games just have spaghetti code and
                                    also works, or are implemented as a unity project which consumes 7GB of data. Why
                                    not using these magical wonders?
                                </i>
                            </blockquote>

                                    This is a good question. First of, i dont have the
                                    <a href="https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Thu%27um">Thu'um</a>, which is
                                    required to make a sucessful game:
                                </p>
                                <p class="center">
                                    <i>IT JUST WORKS</i>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I have to follow more traditional ways of game making. I would like to know what
                                    happens under the bonnet when i develop a game. In addition, this project should
                                    also be a kind of showpiece to make my skills presentable.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I would also like to be able to reuse the basic building blocks of the game, be it
                                    for another platformer or a top down RPG like 'The legend of Zelda'. That is, all
                                    the basic elements like tiles, timer, sound and file input/output can be bundled and
                                    neatly decapsulated. This means I never have to start from scratch again with the
                                    next project.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Since I am only a single developer, I have to try to have tools check my quality. A
                                    clean division of the project is also beneficial for this.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    On the subject of third-party libraries: Of course I can use a third-party system
                                    and pray that with 2-3 clicks and wizards what I want will happen. But I want to
                                    know what happens internally. I want a small system, without overhead and
                                    unnecessary dependencies.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    As a basic structure, I have thought of the following:
                                    <img
                                        class="materialboxed"
                                        src="img/day_2/structure.png"
                                        data-caption="Rough structure of the game and engine"
                                        style="margin: auto; max-width:100%"
                                    />
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Even if layer architectures can lead to problems now and then, I would still use
                                    these 3 layers:
                                </p>
                                <dl>
                                    <dt>Engine layer</dt>
                                    <dd>on which all game-unspecific classes, functions and algorithms are located</dd>
                                    <dt>Extensions layer</dt>
                                    <dd>
                                        which provides extended functionalities, and can be added or omitted depending
                                        on the game
                                    </dd>
                                    <dt>Game layer</dt>
                                    <dd>
                                        where the specific levels, entities and mechanics reside. These should be so
                                        specific that they cannot be reused
                                    </dd>
                                </dl>

                            <h3>Yet another Platformer</h3>
                            <p>
                                After a long period of extreme programming, I decided to take the project of developing
                                a platformer game seriously once again. It all started with a tutorial by
                                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8A0M0eDttdB11MHxX58vXQ"
                                    >Meth Meth Method on Youtube</a
                                >, implementing Super Mario Bros. in Javascript and HTML 5.
                            </p>
                            <div class="more">
                                <p>
                                    Right from the start, I thought Typescript might have some advantages, and adopted
                                    his steps in Typescript. In the process, I managed to make one or two abstractions
                                    and/or revisions, so that I ended up with a modular code state. In this, I could
                                    replace the game (here Super Mario) on an engine at will.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I decided to remove all Super Mario resources and build a new game inspired by
                                    various platformers on the engine.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    For this, however, it was important to have a stable engine. After weeks of
                                    refactorings and try and error, I had a working code, but neither tests nor a build
                                    path. So this should be my first step. A combination of
                                    <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> workflows and
                                    <a href="https://sonarcloud.io">sonarcloud</a> should give me enough confidence
                                    about my code to start the project.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    At the moment I have 1.2k lines of typescript code, with a still too low test
                                    coverage, but the worst mistakes are already removed, so I can start the actual game
                                    soon.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The project will be
                                    <a href="https://github.com/DialThetti/xBlrrer">open source</a> as it is developed,
                                    and I will continue to report as the game grows.
