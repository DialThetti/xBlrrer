                        <h5>Yet another Platformer</h5>
                        <p>
                            After a long period of extreme programming, I decided to take the project of developing a
                            platformer game seriously once again. It all started with a tutorial by
                            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8A0M0eDttdB11MHxX58vXQ"
                                >Meth Meth Method on Youtube</a
                            >, implementing Super Mario Bros. in Javascript and HTML 5.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Right from the start, I thought Typescript might have some advantages, and adopted his steps in
                            Typescript. In the process, I managed to make one or two abstractions and/or revisions, so
                            that I ended up with a modular code state. In this, I could replace the game (here Super
                            Mario) on an engine at will.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I decided to remove all Super Mario resources and build a new game inspired by various
                            platformers on the engine.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For this, however, it was important to have a stable engine. After weeks of refactorings and
                            try and error, I had a working code, but neither tests nor a build path. So this should be
                            my first step. A combination of <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> workflows and
                            <a href="https://sonarcloud.io">sonarcloud</a> should give me enough confidence about my
                            code to start the project.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At the moment I have 1.2k lines of typescript code, with a still too low test coverage, but
                            the worst mistakes are already removed, so I can start the actual game soon.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The project will be <a href="https://github.com/DialThetti/xBlrrer">open source</a> as it is developed, and I will continue to report as the game grows.
