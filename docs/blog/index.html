                            Yesterday I realised how much copying and pasting I have to do to create a blog entry. It's
                            not very useful in the long run. So I decided to create a
                            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components" target="blank"
                                >web component</a
                            >
                            for individual blog entries.
                            <h3>What is a web component?</h3>
                            <p>
                                Anyone who has written HTML knows DOM elements like <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and
                                <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>. With a web component, you can create your own HTML tags. This
                                way, I don't have to copy the entire structure over and over again, but can simply use
                                the following blog:
                            </p>

                            <h3>How does it work?</h3>
                            <p>
                                To make this blog entry web component work, I created a new
                                <a href="https://github.com/DialThetti/blog-utils" target="blank">repository</a>
                                . This contains an
                                <a href="https://angular.io/" target="blank">Angular</a>
                                project. Angular is a TypeScript-based web framework. With it I can easily create
                                components, define input and output, and write encapsulated Javascript logic. I don't
                                have to worry about the site as a whole when I create a web component, just the
                                component itself, because all the functionality stays in that component. You can compare
                                it roughly with the old iframes.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Why an Engine</h3>
                            <blockquote>
                                <i>
                                    But DialThetti, why do you need an engine? Other games just have spaghetti code and
                                    also works, or are implemented as a unity project which consumes 7GB of data. Why
                                    not using these magical wonders?
                                </i>
                            </blockquote>

                        <span slot="full">
                            <p>
                                This is a good question. First of, I dont have the
                                <a href="https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Thu%27um" target="blank">Thu'um</a>, which
                                is required to make a sucessful game:
                            </p>
                            <p class="center">
                                <i>IT JUST WORKS</i>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I have to follow more traditional ways of game making. I would like to know what happens
                                under the bonnet when i develop a game. In addition, this project should also be a kind
                                of showpiece to make my skills presentable.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I would also like to be able to reuse the basic building blocks of the game, be it for
                                another platformer or a top down RPG like 'The legend of Zelda'. That is, all the basic
                                elements like tiles, timer, sound and file input/output can be bundled and neatly
                                decapsulated. This means I never have to start from scratch again with the next project.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Since I am only a single developer, I have to try to have tools check my quality. A
                                clean division of the project is also beneficial for this.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                On the subject of third-party libraries: Of course I can use a third-party system and
                                pray that with 2-3 clicks and wizards what I want will happen. But I want to know what
                                happens internally. I want a small system, without overhead and unnecessary
                                dependencies.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As a basic structure, I have thought of the following:
                                <img
                                    class="materialboxed"
                                    src="img/day_2/structure.png"
                                    data-caption="Rough structure of the game and engine"
                                    style="margin: auto; max-width: 100%"
                                />
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Even if layer architectures can lead to problems now and then, I would still use these 3
                                layers:
                            </p>
                            <dl>
                                <dt>Engine layer</dt>
                                <dd>on which all game-unspecific classes, functions and algorithms are located</dd>
                                <dt>Extensions layer</dt>
                                <dd>
                                    which provides extended functionalities, and can be added or omitted depending on
                                    the game
                                </dd>
                                <dt>Game layer</dt>
                                <dd>
                                    where the specific levels, entities and mechanics reside. These should be so
                                    specific that they cannot be reused
                                </dd>
                            </dl>

                            <h3>Yet another Platformer</h3>
                            <p>
                                After a long period of extreme programming, I decided to take the project of developing
                                a platformer game seriously once again. It all started with a tutorial by
                                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8A0M0eDttdB11MHxX58vXQ"
                                    >Meth Meth Method on Youtube</a
                                >, implementing Super Mario Bros. in Javascript and HTML 5.
                            </p>
                        </span>
                        <span slot="full">
                            <p>
                                Right from the start, I thought Typescript might have some advantages, and adopted his
                                steps in Typescript. In the process, I managed to make one or two abstractions and/or
                                revisions, so that I ended up with a modular code state. In this, I could replace the
                                game (here Super Mario) on an engine at will.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I decided to remove all Super Mario resources and build a new game inspired by various
                                platformers on the engine.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For this, however, it was important to have a stable engine. After weeks of refactorings
                                and try and error, I had a working code, but neither tests nor a build path. So this
                                should be my first step. A combination of
                                <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> workflows and
                                <a href="https://sonarcloud.io">sonarcloud</a> should give me enough confidence about my
                                code to start the project.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                At the moment I have 1.2k lines of typescript code, with a still too low test coverage,
                                but the worst mistakes are already removed, so I can start the actual game soon.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The project will be
                                <a href="https://github.com/DialThetti/xBlrrer">open source</a> as it is developed, and
                                I will continue to report as the game grows.
                            </p>
